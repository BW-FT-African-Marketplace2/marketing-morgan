            <p>Just use the old one inch brush. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's have a little bit of fun today. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. Don't be bashful drop me a line.</p>

            <p>That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Let that brush dance around there and play. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy.</p>

            <p>We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Just use the old one inch brush. We need dark in order to show light.</p>
